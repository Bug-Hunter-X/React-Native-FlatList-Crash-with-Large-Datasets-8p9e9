This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and trying to render a large number of items.  The error message might not be explicit, but the app will crash or become unresponsive. The root cause is usually related to inefficient rendering or excessive memory consumption.  A simple example illustrating the issue:
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeArrayOfData} // largeArrayOfData is a very large array
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```
