The solution involves optimizing the `FlatList` component's rendering behavior using the `windowSize` and `initialNumToRender` props:
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeArrayOfData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  windowSize={10} // Adjust as needed
  initialNumToRender={10} // Adjust as needed
/>
```

By setting `windowSize`, you control how many items are rendered around the visible area, and `initialNumToRender` specifies the initial number of items to render.  These settings significantly reduce memory usage and improve responsiveness, preventing crashes when dealing with large datasets.  Experiment with different `windowSize` and `initialNumToRender` values to find the optimal balance for your specific app and dataset size.
